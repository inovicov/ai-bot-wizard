# AI bot wizard MVP

## Get started

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

## Description

Some content block describing the process of creating an AI bot with table listing intents available for integration.

## What could be done to improve this

- Add possibility to crete own intents 
- Add block with demo chat window in order to test a bot created with selected intents
- Would be nice to have some more graphics

## Technical todos

If improve steps described above were integrated it would be nice to have

- Redux/Redux-Saga for state management as we would have forms and extended local state. Also required to introduce some kind of fake chat where we can test the bot.
- Snapshot/Unit tests
